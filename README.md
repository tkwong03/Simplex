# Simplex
Python program that solve Linear Programming problems using the Simplex method. Uses the NumPy library.

## Functionality

This program performs pivots using Bland's rule to prevent cycling. It also checks for infeasibility and unboundedness.

For infeasibility, it detects infeasibility and doesn't perform the simplex algorithm. I'm planning to implement the phase 1 algorithm to handle initial infeasible dictionaries.
