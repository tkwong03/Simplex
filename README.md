# Simplex
Python program that solve Linear Programming problems using the Simplex method. Uses the NumPy library.

## Functionality

This program performs pivots using Bland's rule to prevent cycling.

For now, the program does not check for infeasibility or unboundedness. I will add this at a later date.
